# Executive Summary

## Entitle — Feature Enablement as a Service (FEaaS)

Modern SaaS products repeatedly re-implement the same non-differentiating logic: feature gating, plan entitlements, trials, usage limits, rollouts, and kill switches. Over time, this logic becomes deeply embedded across services and frontends, tightly coupling commercial decisions to application code and making even small changes risky and slow.

The core issue is not engineering capability, but **ownership**. Entitlement and access policy evolves into business‑critical infrastructure that most teams are forced to build, operate, and maintain indefinitely, despite it not being a core competitive differentiator.

## The Opportunity

This project introduces **Feature Enablement as a Service (FEaaS)** — a dedicated platform that externalizes **commercial access policy**, while leaving business logic and behavior firmly within client systems.

FEaaS operates as a low‑latency **Policy Decision Platform**. Client applications consult the platform at well‑defined decision boundaries to determine whether a capability is allowed and under what limits, and then enforce those decisions locally.
