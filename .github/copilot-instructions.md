# Astro Website Project

## Project Overview
This is an Astro website project with TypeScript support, modern component architecture, and clean styling.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Astro component conventions
- Use modular components
- Implement responsive design patterns

### Project Structure
- `/src/pages/` - Page components and routes
- `/src/components/` - Reusable components
- `/src/layouts/` - Layout templates
- `/public/` - Static assets

### Development Workflow
- Use `npm run dev` to start development server
- Use `npm run build` to create production build
- Use `npm run preview` to preview production build

## Astro-Specific Best Practices
- Prefer `.astro` components for content-heavy pages
- Use framework components (React, Vue, etc.) only when needed for interactivity
- Leverage Astro's partial hydration for optimal performance
- Use Content Collections for structured content
