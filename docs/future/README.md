# Future Enhancements — Post-MVP Planning

**Status:** All content in this folder is deferred until MVP validation  
**Priority:** Low (focus on shipping MVP first)

---

## What's in This Folder

This directory contains **strategic thinking** about potential future capabilities and enhancements to Entitle. These documents capture ideas and early designs that are explicitly **not part of MVP (v1.0)**.

---

## Documents

### Planning & Strategy

**[IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md)** — High-level list of potential v2.0 features  
Quick reference for future capabilities we're considering based on anticipated customer needs.

---

### Detailed Future Contexts

**[usage_tracking_context.md](usage_tracking_context.md)** — Usage limits and advisory signals  
Detailed bounded context design for tracking capability consumption (deferred to v1.1+).

---

## When This Content Becomes Active

Content in this folder transitions to active development when:

1. **MVP is validated** (10+ production customers)
2. **Customer patterns emerge** (3+ customers request same capability)
3. **Technical foundation is stable** (no breaking changes to core PDP)
4. **Team capacity exists** (MVP is operationally stable)

---

## Design Philosophy

Future features will be designed with:
- Real customer feedback (not speculation)
- Production learnings from MVP
- Demonstrated patterns across multiple customers
- Clear ROI and adoption projections

**We do not:**
- Pre-commit to features before validation
- Design solutions for hypothetical problems
- Compromise MVP simplicity for future capabilities

---

## Contributing

If you have ideas for future capabilities:

1. Add a brief entry to [IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md)
2. Include the customer problem statement
3. Note what would trigger detailed design
4. Keep it high-level (no detailed specs yet)

**Do not:**
- Create detailed design docs for unvalidated features
- Commit resources to future work before MVP ships
- Let future planning distract from MVP execution
